Welcome to our quirky world of teapots disguised as vehicles! Our "Code 418" team of `Anita, Brenda, Kenneth & Marlon`, created a Full Stack application, `*TeaWhips*` using ReactJS, ExpressJS, PostgresSQL, pg-promise. `TeaWhips` is our unique platform specializing in teapots shaped like vehicles. A fun fact: none of us even had a clue that this sort of thing exists. The idea was an organic one -- Kenneth has a love for cars, and was drumming-up an app idea based around an e-commerce site for that, but randomly Anita for some wild reason, interjected with an idea about teapots? You can't make this stuff up! So, all at once, we decided to Google search a combination between cars and teapots, and lo' and behold, there was such a thing as car-teapots, and thriving, vibrant all over Etsy! So there you have it, our app idea was born.

The app allows users to register, browse, review and click around to enjoy a unique collection of whimsical teapot designs. Users can explore various vehicle-inspired teapots and infuse their tea time with a touch of novelty and personality. The app caters to tea/teapot enthusiasts who appreciate creativity and novelty in their tea accessories, offering a curated selection of teapots designed to delight and inspire.

In addition, the four of us also worked closely together, practicing and using the following below **Project Tools & Skills**:

# Features
-First off, our `landing page` has an `About` link  in the `Header/Navbar` that, if clicked, connects the user to our team that built this app with brief profiles on each of us. Don't forget to see what we all look like ü´ñ when you gloss over each of us!

-Immediately upon coming onto our `Landing page`, wait for it -- our boiling, vehicular teapot navigates from right-to-left of the screen. Click on this 'TeaWhip' after it makes a sudden stop at the center of the screen, then you're taken to a page to see all our bizarre, quirky and cool `TeaWhips` products.

-We have a `TeaWhip` for the many enthusiasts out there! From tracktors, to racing cars, to classic vintage old school luxuries, there's something for you. Clicking on any that you fancy, you're able to purchase, review and give 1-5 ‚≠êÔ∏è-ratings. Afterwards, the user is even given a form with an option to edit or delete reviews on any particular `TeaWhip`.

1. Opted-in to use the User Login to our `TeaWhips` application, using the already prepared User Auth login front and backend starters.

2. Most, if not all our images, are stored and uploaded in our `Cloudinary` account. 

3. Created a `Search Bar` to enable users to search data for the various product options available in our `TeaWhips` app.

4. `CSS Animations` for our `Landing Page` is used on our moving, vehicular `TeaWhips` logo.

5. We also have `Error Components` in our code.

6. There's also a designed `CSS 404 Page` included in our app.

# 5 USER STORIES

1. As a user, a user name and password is required to log-in to access our diverse range of TeaWhip products!

2. As a first-time user, proper navigation and smooth functionality to reach each TeaWhip to show details is a must.

3. As a repeat user, a `search bar` option is great to be able to find specific TeaWhips that was seen before.

4. As an avid user, TeaWhips should be a fun and an easy-to-use app, always available for a user to refer to other enthusiasts alike.

5. As a user, there must be options to post, rate, edit and delete reviews on the TeaWhips.

## TWO (2) User Personas:

<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dgifdj6nx/image/upload/t_Gradient fade/v1711643822/TeaWhips16-Jenny2_re98hy.avif" alt="Jenny!" width="300" height="300">
1. Meet **Jenny**, She adores cars and loves sipping tea while admiring her model car collection. Seeking to add novelty to her tea time, she discovers the "TeaWhips" app. She downloads it, uncovering a new world of vehicle-themed teapots. Excited, she begins exploring, eager to find the perfect addition to her collection!

2. Very different to Jenny, is **Carl**. He's an artist with a short attention span, and also spends less time on apps because of his stance on limiting technology, or too much if it, in his life. Our TeaWhips has to have an appeal to lure him to not log off, and hopefully purchase one or two teapots, or at least grab his attention enough, to revisit in the near future to add to his wild art collection.
